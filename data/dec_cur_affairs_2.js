There are several reasons for this:</li>\n<li><strong>Monoculture in Punjab:</strong><br>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li><strong>Monoculture</strong> is the agricultural practice of growing a single crop, plant, or livestock species, variety, or breed in a field or farming system at a time.</li>\n<li>Wheat and paddy constitute about 84.6% of the total area planted to all crops compromising on pulses, maize, bajra and oilseeds cotton.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Problem of Monoculture:</strong><br>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>Growing the same crops year after year on the same land increases vulnerability to pest and disease attacks. The <strong>more the crop and genetic diversity,</strong> the <strong>more difficult it is for insects and pathogens</strong> to devise a way to pierce through plant resistance. <strong>Hence, statement 1 is correct.</strong></li>\n<li>Wheat and paddy cannot fix nitrogen, unlike pulses and legumes, that fixes nitrogen from the atmosphere. <br>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>Their continuous cultivation without any crop rotation, then, leads to depletion of soil nutrients and growing dependence on chemical fertilisers and pesticides. Thus they require more fertilisers than pulses.<strong> Hence, statement 2 is not correct.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Paddy requires a huge amount of water.</strong> <br>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>Punjab’s groundwater table has been declining by 0.5 meters per annum on an average due to <strong>paddy</strong> and the state’s policy of supplying free power for irrigation. It has encouraged farmers to grow long-duration water-guzzling varieties of paddy like Pusa-44.</li>\n<li><strong>Pusa-44</strong> has a <strong>high yield of rice</strong> but a long duration growth period.<br>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\">\n<li>Long duration means transplanting by mid-May (Peak Summer), to enable harvesting from October and timely planting of the next wheat crop. But being peak summer time, it also translated into very high water requirements. <strong>Hence, statement 3 is not correct.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n"
