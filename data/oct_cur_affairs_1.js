The missing ice also exposes the surface waters to more wind. This mixes up colder freshwater at the surface and warmer saltwater below, raising surface temperatures and further melting ice.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Change in Albedo:</strong> When bright and reflective ice (with more albedo) melts, it gives way to a darker ocean (<strong>lowering albedo</strong>); this <strong>amplifies the warming trend</strong> because the<strong> ocean surface absorbs more heat from the Sun</strong> than the surface of snow and ice.<br>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>A high albedo means the surface reflects the majority of the radiation that hits it and absorbs the rest. </li>\n<li>A low albedo means a surface reflects a small amount of the incoming radiation and absorbs the rest.
